Advanced ZIP Password Recovery (or AZPR) is a program to recover lost or forgotten passwords to archives (compressed files) created in programs like WinZip, PKZip etc. The key features of AZPR are: 

- The program has a convenient user interface  
- The program is very fast: brute-force attack speed is up to fifteen million passwords per second on modern CPUs like Pentium 4 (Prescott)  
- The program can work with archives containing only one encrypted file  
- Archives created by various software packages are supported  
- Self-extracting archives are supported  
- The program is customizable: you can set the password length (or length range), the character set to be used to generate the passwords, and a couple of other options  
- You can select the custom character set for brute-force attack (non-English characters are supported)  
- Dictionary-based attack (with word mutations) is available  
- The "brute-force with mask" attack is available  
- Very fast known-plaintext attack is available
- You can interrupt the program at any time, and resume from the same point later  
- The program can work in the background, using the CPU only when it is in idle state  
 
Please note, however, that for the password is not stored anywhere in the archive (ZIP file), and so it cannot be just extracted or decrypted. Instead, AZPR can recover it by trying different passwords: all possible combinations in a given range, or from a wordlist, etc. AZPR can test as many as fifteen million passwords per second, and so the likelihood of finding a valid one is very high. There is still no guarantee that the password will be recovered, but here the human factor plays its role: most people use short and/or easy to remember passwords. We estimate the success rate as 90-95%. See the help file for more information.
